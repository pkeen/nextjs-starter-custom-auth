## Custom Auth Flow

I want to experiment with a custom auth flow that uses a combination of cookies and JWTs. The idea is to use cookies to store the user's session and JWTs to store the user's identity. The JWT will be stored in a cookie and will be used to authenticate the user. The cookie will be used to store the user's session and will be used to authorize the user.

I am experimenting with different auth providers, and this one is a customized auth flow, this may not be what I use, but will surely help me understand the providers I am using better.
